# hyphenator

tl;dr: This repository is no longer being updated.

I used to use this project for hyphenation in web documents. Since CSS3/HTML5 have native support for hyphenation which is working in almost every modern browser I will no longer update this mirror in any way. If you're still interested in hyphenator, please go to the [original project site](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator).
